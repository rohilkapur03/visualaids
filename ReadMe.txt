Purpose: 

Creating visual aids, such as charts and graphs, is a task that falls within the domain of computer graphics and computer vision. AI models trained in these areas can use a combination of deep learning techniques and computer graphics algorithms to generate charts and other visual aids.

One approach to improving AI models for chart generation would be to train them on a large dataset of chart images and their corresponding data, allowing the model to learn the relationships between the data and the visual representation. The model could then use this learned information to generate new charts based on input data.

Another approach would be to develop AI models that have a more intuitive understanding of the data and the chart types being used. For example, an AI model trained on financial data could be designed to understand the different chart types used in technical analysis and generate charts that are relevant and meaningful to the data being analyzed.

To further improve the quality of the visual aids generated by AI, it may be necessary to incorporate human expertise and feedback into the training process. For example, human analysts could provide input on the style, format, and interpretation of the charts generated by the AI, allowing the model to learn and improve over time.

Overall, improving AI models for chart generation will likely require a multi-disciplinary approach, combining advances in computer graphics, computer vision, deep learning, and human-in-the-loop techniques.
